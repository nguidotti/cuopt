def Solve(data_model, solver_settings=None, log_file=""):
    """
    Solve the Linear Program passed as input and returns the solution.

    Data Model object can be construed through setters
    (see linear_programming.DataModel class) or through a MPS file
    (see cuopt_mps_parser.ParseMps function)


    Notes
    -----
    Both primal and dual solutions are zero-initialized.
    For custom initialization, please refer to `set_initial_primal_solution()`
    and `set_initial_dual_solution()` methods.
    For more details on the Solution object, see linear_programming.Solution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_model : DataModel
        Data model containing a representation of a linear program on standard
        form.
    solver_settings: SolverSettings
        Settings to configure solver configurations.
        By default, it uses default solver settings to solve.

    Returns
    -------
    solution: Solution
        Solution object containing both primal and dual solutions, objectives
        and more statistics about the result.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from cuopt import linear_programming
    >>> from cuopt.linear_programming.solver_settings import SolverMode
    >>>
    >>> data_model = linear_programming.DataModel()
    >>>
    >>> # Set all required fields
    >>> data_model.data_model.set_csr_constraint_matrix(...)
    >>>
    >>> # Build a solver setting object
    >>> settings = linear_programming.SolverSettings()
    >>> # Lower the accuracy from 1e-4 to 1e-2 for a faster result
    >>> settings.set_optimality_tolerance(1e-2)
    >>> # Also change the solver mode to Fast1 which can be faster
    >>> settings.set_pdlp_solver_mode(SolverMode.Fast1)
    >>>
    >>> # Call solve
    >>> solution = linear_programming.Solve(data_model, settings)
    >>>
    >>> # Print solution
    >>> print(solution.get_primal_solution())
    >>> # Print the primal objective
    >>> print(solution.get_primal_objective())
    >>> # Print the value of one specific variable

def BatchSolve(data_model_list, solver_settings=None, log_file=""):

    and total solve time.

    Data Model objects can be construed through setters
    (see linear_programming.DataModel class) or through a MPS file
    (see cuopt_mps_parser.ParseMps function)


    Notes
    -----
    Solving in batch is usually faster than solving one by one.
    The total time to solve the whole batch on the engine side is returned as
    summing up the solutions `get_solve_time` would be incorrect as they are
    solved together in parallel, overlapping multiple solve.
    Both primal and dual solutions are zero-initialized.
    For custom initialization, please refer to `set_initial_primal_solution()`
    and `set_initial_dual_solution()` methods.
    For more details on the Solution object, see linear_programming.Solution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_models : list of DataModel
        Data models containing a representation of a linear program on standard
        form.
    solver_settings: SolverSettings
        Settings to configure solver configurations.
        By default, it uses default solver settings to solve.

    Returns
    -------
    solution: list of Solution
        List of Solution objects containing both primal and dual solutions,
        objectives and more statistics about the result.
    solve_time: double
        The engine solve time for the whole batch in milliseconds as a float64.
