        Add capacity dimensions to model the Capacitated Vehicle Routing
        Problem (CVRP)

        The vehicles have a limited carrying capacity of the

        once to model multiple capacity dimensions (weight, volume, number
        of orders, skills). After solving the problem, the demands on each

          - If vehicle locations is not set, then by default 0th index
