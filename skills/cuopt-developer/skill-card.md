## Description: <br>
Modify, build, test, debug, and contribute to NVIDIA cuOpt (C++/CUDA, Python, server, CI). Use for solver internals, PRs, DCO, and code conventions. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers who modify, build, test, and contribute to the NVIDIA cuOpt GPU-accelerated optimization engine codebase. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- `claude-code` <br>
- `codex` <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 3 evaluation tasks in the NVSkills-Eval external profile (astra-sandbox environment, 1 attempt per task, 50% pass threshold). <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies that the agent loaded the expected skill and workflow. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Checks routing quality, decoy avoidance, and redundant tool usage. <br>
- `accuracy`: Grades final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Checks whether the overall user task completed successfully. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies expected behavior steps, including safety expectations. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Compares token usage with and without the skill. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Dimension | Num | `claude-code` | `codex` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Security | 3 | 100% (+0%) | 100% (+0%) |
| Correctness | 3 | 75% (+20%) | 90% (+43%) |
| Discoverability | 3 | 42% (+25%) | 79% (+52%) |
| Effectiveness | 3 | 95% (+26%) | 78% (+35%) |
| Efficiency | 3 | 48% (+22%) | 77% (+35%) |
