Release Notes 25.05
====================

New Features
------------

- Added concurrent mode that runs PDLP and Dual Simplex together
- Added crossover from PDLP to Dual Simplex
- Added a C API for LP and MILP
- PDLP: Faster iterations and new more robust default PDLPSolverMode Stable2
- Added support for writing out mps file containing user problem. Useful for debugging

Breaking Changes
----------------

- NoTermination is now a NumericalError
- Split cuOpt as libcuopt and cuopt wheel

Improvements
------------

- Hook up MILP Gap parameters and add info about number of nodes explored and simplex iterations
- FJ bug fixes, tests and improvements
- Allow no time limit in MILP
- Refactor routing
- Probing cache optimization
- Diversity improvements for routing
- Enable more compile warnings and faster compile by bypassing rapids fetch
- Constraint prop based on load balanced bounds update
- Logger file handling and bug fixes on MILP
- Add shellcheck to pre-commit and fix warnings

Bug Fixes
---------

- In the solution, ``termination_status`` should be cast to correct enum.
- Fixed a bug using vehicle IDs in construct feasible solution algorithm.
- FP recombiner probing bug fix.
- Fix concurrent LP crashes.
- Fix print relative dual residual.
- Handle empty problems gracefully.
- Improve breaks to allow dimensions at arbitrary places in the route.
- Free var elimination with a substitute variable for each free variable.
- Fixed race condition when resetting vehicle IDs in heterogenous mode.
- cuOpt self-hosted client, some MILPs do not have all fields in ``lp_stats``.
- Fixed RAPIDS logger usage.
- Handle LP state more cleanly, per solution.
- Fixed routing solver intermittent failures.
- Gracefully exit when the problem is infeasible after presolve.
- Fixed bug on dual resizing.
- Fix occasional incorrect solution bound on maximization problems
- Fix inversion of constraint bounds in conditional bounds presolve
- Pdlp fix batch cuda graph
- Fix obj constant on max. Fix undefined memory access at root
- Allow long client version in service version check, this fixes the issue in case version is of the format 25.05.00.dev0

Documentation
-------------
- Restructure documementation to accomdate new APIs
