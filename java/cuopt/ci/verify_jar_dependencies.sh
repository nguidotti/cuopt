# Checks that a classifier JAR can satisfy its own native dependencies.
#
# A JAR is only self-contained if every library it needs is either inside it, part of the CUDA
# toolkit the classifier names, or part of the base system. Anything else resolves on a build
# machine, because the build environment happens to have it, and fails for a consumer who
# installed only the JAR. Linking libcuopt statically surfaced four such libraries one at a time
# (rmm, TBB, NCCL, cuDSS), each as an UnsatisfiedLinkError at run time; this catches that class
# of gap at build time instead.
#
# The check reads DT_NEEDED rather than resolving against a directory, because a build
# environment's lib directory contains every dependency by construction and would make any JAR
# look self-contained.
